Free Consultation:

I offer a free 30 minute consultation.
Contact me and let's set up a time to meet face to face to explore the potential of working together.

Rates

The fee for an individual 55-minute session is $120, and $60 per 30 minutes thereafter. You can talk to me to see if you qualify for the reduced-rate/"sliding scale" fees that I offer. Student discounts also apply.
Group rates are variable and can be discussed in-person.
Fees are payable at your session, in the form of cash, check, or credit card.
If you must cancel your appointment please contact me at least 24 hours in advance. This ensures I can see other clients in the opening and can plan accordingly. You will be responsible for the fee when cancellations are received less than 24 hours in advance.

Insurance

At this time I do not accept insurance. However, many insurance plans will cover my work as an out-of-network provider. Please contact your insurance company for more information.

Forms

Please download, read, fill out and sign the forms below before coming in for your first appointment. The Disclosure Statement is something I need to provide you by law which simply states the way I work and some of the laws governing our work. The Intake Form will provide me some background information about you which will help us in our work and will help me begin to get to know you.
