<h2 id='welcome'>Welcome!</h2>

<img src="/assets/img/Patrick_in_Nature_Installation.jpg" alt="Willy Wonka" class="about-portrait img-responsive">
<p>I am Patrick Dougherty, MA, LMHC. Working in Seattle, I provide counseling services for individuals, ages 17+. I take a gentle approach to counseling, building relationships with my clients in a way that ensures trust and paves the way for powerful growth in many aspects of my clients'&#8217; lives. My personal mission is to recognize every moment in life as an opportunity to create more good in the world, and in so doing, take a more proactive approach to helping myself and others learn the most they can about how helpful we can be to each other.</p>

<p>I have over six years of experience working with children, adolescents, and adults in a variety of settings, ranging from clinical offices and classroom settings, to hospice care situations, to wilderness environments. I am constantly training in new techniques and approaches for helping my clients understand themselves and the choices they can make in their future.</p>

<p>Please take a few moments to peruse my website. Choosing a therapist can be a difficult process. I hope that you appreciate the introduction I have given to myself, so that choosing me, or not, is an easier choice for you. Do not hesitate to contact me to see how I may be of service to you, and thanks for stopping by.</p>
